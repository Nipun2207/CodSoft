        <h2>Understanding Bull and Bear Market
        </h2>
        <p>The bull and bear words that are commonly used in the stock market, come from the way these animals attack their opponents.
            A bull thrusts its horns up in the air, while a bear swipes its paws downward when attacking its opponent.
            So these actions are metaphors for the movement of a stock market.
            If the trend of the market is upwards, it is a bull market and if the trend of the market is downwards, it is a bear market.
